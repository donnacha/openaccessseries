The RIA Open Access Opinion Series
================

#To coincide with the tenth anniversary of the Berlin Declaration on Open Access in November 2013 and to contribute to the ongoing discussions on Open Access within the public research and higher education sectors in Ireland and internationally, the Academy will run an online Open Access series.

Written by MRIA and Academy staff whose work engages with open access developments, the series will offer a series of perspectives on the opportunities and challenges for research and scholarship arising from open access.

Each opinion piece will occupy a prominent position on the front page of the Academy website rotating daily in the lead up to the Berlin commemoration; the Academy public affairs unit will promote the series by tweeting a different opinion piece daily linking it directly to the Academyâ€™s website.

The views and opinions expressed by authors shall be their own and will not reflect, the position of the Academy, but are simply an illustration of the various opinions reflective of the diverse Academy membership.
